# Build system setup

First of all, you will need to install Rust! You can find download instructions for Rust for your operating system under [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

If this is your first time using Rust, don't worry. We will go through all changes step-by-step and every change you'll need to do we be written out. However you will probably profit from learning rust, for which I recommend reading the fantastic [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html)
